# Phishing Meme with Sound

This project is a simple interactive web page that displays a phishing meme image with a sound effect at the background for a Cybersecurity Campaign.
## Features
- **Phishing Meme**: Displays a meme image.
- **Interactive Animation**: The image shakes (using CSS animation) when hovered over.
- **Sound Effect**: Plays a background sound.

## Requirements
No additional requirements are needed as this is a simple static webpage.

## How to Use
1. **Clone or Download** this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any web browser (both mobile and desktop compatible).
3. It will bring you to the animated meme of phishing.
   
## How It Works
- **HTML**: The main content (meme image and iframe for YouTube) is placed in the `index.html` file.
- **CSS**: The teeter animation is applied to the meme image using CSS keyframes.
- **JavaScript**: A script is used to trigger the display of the YouTube iframe and start the sound when the image is clicked.
- **Audio**: The sound is hosted on GitHub, and can be updated by replacing the URL in the audio tag.

## Hosting
This project is hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), which allows static content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to be served directly from a GitHub repository.

### GitHub Pages URL
Once the repository is cloned or downloaded, the project can also be accessed online at the following URL:

[https://username.github.io/repository-name/](https://username.github.io/repository-name/)

Replace `username` with your GitHub username and `repository-name` with the name of your repository.

## File Structure

## Customization
